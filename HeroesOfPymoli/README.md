# pandas-challenge

## Overview
This script was coded in Jupyter Notebook. The data is from a game, with username detail, basic demographics, and details of in-game purchases
 
### Player count
The first calculation is just a basic count of the distinct player names

### PURCHASING ANALYSIS (TOTAL)
The purchasing analysis summarizes the number of unique items, average price, number of purchases, and total revenue. The data is displayed in one row of a dataframe.

## Most Popular Items
This dataframe lists the top five items by total spend, sorted by item price

## Most Profitable Items
This dataframe lists the top five items by total spend, sorted by total purchase value

## Three trends/observations:
### The game is considerably more popular with men
### Even the top spenders don't spend very much on purchases, and the item best sellers don't stand out dramatically from the pack, in terms of volume
### The game is most popular with the 20-24 age group
